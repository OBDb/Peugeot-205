    description: "The Peugeot 205 was a revolutionary small car that transformed Peugeot's image and financial fortunes. Designed by Pininfarina, it featured clean, timeless styling that aged remarkably well throughout its 15-year production run. Available in three and five-door hatchback body styles, plus a unique two-door cabriolet created in collaboration with Pininfarina. Offered with a wide range of powertrains, from economical 954cc base models to the legendary 1.6L and later 1.9L GTI performance variants that delivered up to 130 horsepower and are now considered iconic hot hatches of the era. The 205 also pioneered diesel technology in small cars with its popular XUD engines known for exceptional efficiency and reliability. The interior was simple but well-designed, with good visibility and space utilization despite compact exterior dimensions. Variants included the luxurious Roland Garros, sporty Gentry, rugged Raid, and numerous special editions. The high-performance GTI models featured distinctive red interior detailing, sport seats, and upgraded instrumentation. The 205's greatest achievement was perhaps its chassis, which delivered an exceptional balance of ride comfort and handling precision that set new standards for the class. The motorsport-developed 205 T16 Group B rally car shared little more than styling with the road car but cemented the model's sporting credentials with two World Rally Championships. The 205's success restored Peugeot's finances and reputation for creating exceptional small cars, with over 5.3 million units produced during its remarkably long production run."
